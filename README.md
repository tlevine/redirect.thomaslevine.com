HTTP Redirect API
=========================

HTTP redirects are easy, but I couldn't find anyone who would host them for
as cheap as they are, so I figured I'd make a service myself. For now, it's
free. If shit tons of people start using it and I need to get another server,
it'll be cheap.

## What do I mean by "HTTP redirects"?
